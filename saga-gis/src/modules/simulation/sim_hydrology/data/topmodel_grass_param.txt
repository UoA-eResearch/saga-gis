# Catchment name
Subcatchment 1

# A:		Total catchment area
#									  [m^2]
#
# qs0:		Initial subsurface flow per unit area
#									  [m/h]
#		   "The first streamflow input is assumed to represent
#		    only the subsurface flow contribution in the watershed."
#								- Ref[S.C.Liaw]
# lnTe:		Areal average of ln(T0) = ln(Te)
#								    [ln(m^2/h)]
# m:		Model parameter
#									    [m]
# Sr0:		Initial root zone storage deficit
#									    [m]
# Srmax:	Maximum root zone storage deficit
#									    [m]
# td:		Unsaturated zone time delay per unit storage deficit
#		   ( > 0.0)						    [h]
#  OR
# -alpha:	Effective vertical hydraulic gradient
#		   ( <= 0.0)	-10 means that alpha = 10
# vch:		Main channel routing velocity
#									  [m/h]
# vr:		Internal subcatchment routing velocity
#									  [m/h]
#
# infex:	Calculate infiltration excess if not zero (integer)
# K0:		Surface hydraulic conductivity
#									  [m/h]
# psi:		Wetting front suction
#									    [m]
# dtheta:	Water content change across the wetting front
#
# nch:		Number of distance increments
#
# d:		Distance from catchment
#									    [m]
#		   The first value should be the mainstream distance from
#		   the subcatchment outlet to the catchment outlet.
# Ad_r:		Cumulative area ratio of subcatchment (0.0 to 1.0)
#		   The first value should be zero.
