Terrain View Factor	
The angle between the surface and the incoming light beams, measured in radians.	
The terrain exaggeration factor allows to increase the shading contrasts in flat areas.	
The transmittance of the atmosphere (usually between 60 and 80%)	
The unobstructed hemisphere given as percentage.	
This value is ignored if set to zero.	
This value is used as constant if no vapour pressure grid is given.
