The resulting grid gives the altitude above the channel network in the same units as the elevation data.	
This is the horizontal component of the overland flow	
This is the vertical component of the overland flow	
This optional grid output contains the interpolated channel network base level elevations.	
This shapes layer will contain the resulting channel network in vector format (lines).
